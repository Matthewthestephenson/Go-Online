Removal rules:

  when a piece is placed, check all 4 adjacent squares
    //check opponent's pieces for capture
    initialize static/instance var list
    check a piece's neighbors:
      if a free space, return
      if a player's piece or in list, continue
      if opponent's piece, add to list, recursively call this on that cell

      //check current's pieces for capture
      call same function on current player



Prevent repetition:



Territory:
  number of tiles occupied + amount of empty spaces surrounded adjacently with board edges and player's pieces
